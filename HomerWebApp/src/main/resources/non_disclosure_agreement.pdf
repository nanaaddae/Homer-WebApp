Nondisclosure Agreement

This Nondisclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of the date of electronic acceptance by the Recipient ("Recipient"), by and between the Discloser ("Discloser") and the Recipient.

Definition of Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall include all information or material that has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Discloser is engaged. If Confidential Information is in written form, the Discloser shall label or stamp the materials with the word "Confidential." If Confidential Information is transmitted verbally, the Discloser shall promptly provide writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Confidential Information.

Exclusions from Confidential Information. Recipient's obligations under this Agreement do not extend to information that is: (a) publicly known at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of the Recipient; (b) discovered or created by the Recipient before disclosure by Discloser; (c) learned by the Recipient through legitimate means other than from Discloser or Discloser's representatives; or (d) is disclosed by Recipient with Discloser's prior written approval.

Obligations of Recipient. Recipient shall hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strictest confidence for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Discloser. Recipient shall carefully restrict access to Confidential Information to employees, contractors and third parties as is reasonably required and shall require those persons to sign nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those in this Agreement. Recipient shall not, without the Discloser's prior written approval, use any Confidential Information in any way directly or indirectly, for Recipient's benefit or for the benefit of any third party. Recipient shall return to Discloser any and all records, notes, and other written, printed, or tangible materials in its possession pertaining to Confidential Information immediately if Discloser requests it in writing.

Time Periods. The nondisclosure provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Recipient's duty to hold Confidential Information in confidence shall remain in effect until the Confidential Information no longer qualifies as a trade secret or until Discloser sends written notice releasing Recipient from this Agreement, whichever occurs first.

Relationships. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute either party a partner, joint venture or employee of the other party for any purpose.

Severability. If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be interpreted so as best to affect the intent of the parties.

Integration. This Agreement expresses the complete understanding of the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals
